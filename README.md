# Hello Github
Hello **Github**! I'm Dorin, a curious and energetic guy that started to learn coding a couple of months ago on **FreeCodeCamp** (great place to learn, check it out if you haven't yet). This is my first time here. Please feel free to contribute in any way, correct me, make suggestions or simply say Hi!
