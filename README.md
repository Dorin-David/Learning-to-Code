Learning Github...

Hello world! I'm Dorin, and this is my first time on Github. I'm really excited about this new path, and I hope I'll learn a lot. I'm currently studying JavaScript, and I'm looking forward to learn and collaborate with anyone willing to do so. Hopefully, it will be a great journey!
