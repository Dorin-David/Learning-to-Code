Here I store the projects I've done for the FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. These are my first HTML and CSS projects ever done. Auto-feedback: now that I look at these projects I personally feel not satisfied. The idea behind sharing them is to keep track of my progress as I dig deeper into CSS and gain more knowledge as to be able to build more good-looking and accessible projects...
